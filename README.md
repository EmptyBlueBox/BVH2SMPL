# BVH2SMPL



## Usage

### Install the dependencies:

```shell
conda create -n animation python=3.10.12
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download model:

Goto [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de) 

Download this one: `[Download version 1.0.0 for Python 2.7 (female/male. 10 shape PCs)`

Rename the neutral model into `SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl` and put it into `./src/rendering_utils/smpl`

### Goto soruce code folder:

```shell
cd ./src
```

### Run the script:

1. put the bvh files into `./bvh` folder, then run script to preprocessing the files

   note: you'll have to find out the time window the people is about to sit, and put the frame upper and lower range into the script.

  ```shell
  python preprocess.py
  ```

2. run the script to retarget the motion

    ```shell
    python retargeting.py
    ```

3. run the script to render the result

   note: in this part you must have cuda.

  ```shell
  python rendering.py
  ```

4. run the script to generate the video

   Goto `./results-objs` folder, then create a blender file, click on the bottom left, choose  `Text Editor` , then click `new` to create a new script, paste `./results-objs/script-objs_to_animation-in_blender.py` and run it. Like the picture.

   Then click the `Output` , choose 60fps (derived from the bvh), choose the output folder, choose the File Format as `FFmpeg Video` .

   Then click `Render â†’ Render Video` , wait for some time and you will get your video in the output folder.

## Goal

I propose an end-to-end method to convert bvh file to SMPL mesh representation. 

And you can also simply modify the `retargeting.py` file to fit another bvh hierarchy.

## Results

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="result-animation/All.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Goto `./results-animation` folder to see more results.

## Quotation

Code of step 3 is mostly from [motion-diffusion-model](https://github.com/GuyTevet/motion-diffusion-model)
